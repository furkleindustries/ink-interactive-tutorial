## 4) Diverts

### Knots divert to knots

You can tell the story to move from one knot to another using `->`, a "divert arrow". Diverts happen immediately without any user input.

#### Diverts are invisible

Diverts are intended to be seamless and can even happen mid-sentence:

<Example id="diverts-seamless" />

#### Glue
	
The default behaviour inserts line-breaks before every new line of content. In some cases, however, content must insist on not having a line-break, and it can do so using `<>`, or "glue".

<Example id="glue" />

You can't use too much glue: multiple glues next to each other have no additional effect. (And there's no way to "negate" a glue; once a line is sticky, it'll stick.)
