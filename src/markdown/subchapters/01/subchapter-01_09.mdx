## 9) Game Queries

**ink** provides a few useful 'game level' queries about game state, for use in conditional logic. They're not quite parts of the language, but they're always available, and they can't be edited by the author. In a sense, they're the "standard library functions" of the language.

The convention is to name these in capital letters.

### CHOICE_COUNT

`CHOICE_COUNT` returns the number of options created so far in the current chunk. So for instance.

	*	{false} Option A
	* 	{true} Option B
	*  {CHOICE_COUNT() == 1} Option C

produces two options, B and C. This can be useful for controlling how many options a player gets on a turn. 

### TURNS_SINCE

`TURNS_SINCE` returns the number of moves (formally, player inputs) since a particular knot/stitch was last visited.

A value of 0 means "was seen as part of the current chunk". A value of -1 means "has never been seen". Any other positive value means it has been seen that many turns ago.

	*	{TURNS_SINCE(-> sleeping.intro) > 10} You are feeling tired... -> sleeping 
	* 	{TURNS_SINCE(-> laugh) == 0}  You try to stop laughing.

Note that the parameter passed to `TURNS_SINCE` is a "divert target", not simply the knot address itself (because the knot address is a number - the read count - not a location in the story...)

TODO: (requirement of passing `-c` to the compiler)

#### Advanced: more queries

You can make your own external functions, though the syntax is a bit different: see the section on functions below.
