## 5) Branching The Flow

### Basic branching

Combining knots, options and diverts gives us the basic structure of a choose-your-own game.

### Branching and joining

Using diverts, the writer can branch the flow, and join it back up again, without showing the player that the flow has rejoined.

### The story flow 

Knots and diverts combine to create the basic story flow of the game. This flow is "flat" - there's no call-stack, and diverts aren't "returned" from. 

In most ink scripts, the story flow starts at the top, bounces around in a spaghetti-like mess, and eventually, hopefully, reaches a `-> END`.

The very loose structure means writers can get on and write, branching and rejoining without worrying about the structure that they're creating as they go. There's no boiler-plate to creating new branches or diversions, and no need to track any state.

#### Advanced: Loops

You absolutely can use diverts to create looped content, and **ink** has several features to exploit this, including ways to make the content vary itself, and ways to control how often options can be chosen. 

See the sections on Varying Text and Conditional Options for more information.

Oh, and the following is legal and not a great idea:
