## 8) Variable Text

### Text can vary

So far, all the content we've seen has been static, fixed pieces of text. But content can also vary at the moment of being printed. 

### Sequences, cycles and other alternatives

The simplest variations of text are provided by alternatives, which are selected from depending on some kind of rule. **ink** supports several types. Alternatives are written inside `{`...`}` curly brackets, with elements separated by `|` symbols (vertical divider lines).

These are only useful if a piece of content is visited more than once!

#### Types of alternatives

**Sequences** (the default):

A sequence (or a "stopping block") is a set of alternatives that tracks how many times its been seen, and each time, shows the next element along. When it runs out of new content it continues the show the final element.

<Example id="sequences-1" />

<Example id="sequences-2" />

**Cycles** (marked with a `&`): 
	
Cycles are like sequences, but they loop their content.

<Example id="cycles" />	

**Once-only** (marked with a `!`):
	
Once-only alternatives are like sequences, but when they run out of new content to display, they display nothing. (You can think of a once-only alternative as a sequence with a blank last entry.)

<Example id="once-only-alternatives" />
	
**Shuffles** (marked with a `~`):
	
Shuffles produce randomised output.

<Example id="shuffles" />

#### Features of Alternatives 

Alternatives can contain blank elements.

<Example id="alternatives-with-blank-elements" />

Alternatives can be nested.

<Example id="nested-alternatives" />

Alternatives can include divert statements. 

<Example id="alternatives-with-diverts" />

They can also be used inside choice text:

<Example id="alternatives-inside-choice-text" />
	
(...with one caveat; you can't start an option's text with a &#0123;, as it'll look like a conditional.)

(...but the caveat has a caveat, if you escape a whitespace \ before your { ink will recognise it as text.)

#### Examples

Alternatives can be used inside loops to create the appearance of intelligent, state-tracking gameplay without particular effort.

Here's a one-knot version of whack-a-mole. Note we use once-only options, and a fallback, to ensure the mole doesn't move around, and the game will always end.

And here's a bit of lifestyle advice. Note the sticky choice - the lure of the television will never fade:

#### Sneak Preview: Multiline alternatives
**ink** has another format for making alternatives of varying content blocks, too. See the section on [multiline blocks](/chapter-03) for details.

### Conditional Text

Text can also vary depending on logical tests, just as options can.

	{met_blofeld: "I saw him. Only for a moment." }

and

	"His real name was {met_blofeld.learned_his_name: Franz|a secret}."

These can appear as separate lines, or within a section of content. They can even be nested, so:

	{met_blofeld: "I saw him. Only for a moment. His real name was {met_blofeld.learned_his_name: Franz|kept a secret}." | "I missed him. Was he particularly evil?" }
	
can produce either:

	"I saw him. Only for a moment. His real name was Franz."

or:

	"I saw him. Only for a moment. His real name was kept a secret."
	
or: 

	"I missed him. Was he particularly evil?"
