## 7) Varying Choices 

### Choices can only be used once

By default, every choice in the game can only be chosen once. If you don't have loops in your story, you'll never notice this behaviour. But if you do use loops, you'll quickly notice your options disappearing...

<Example id="choices-can-only-be-used-once" />

...and on the second loop you have no options left.

#### Fallback choices 

The above example stops where it does, because the next choice ends up in an "out of content" run-time error. 
	
	> 1
	The man with the briefcase looks disgusted as you stumble past him.
	You search desperately for a friendly face in the crowd.
	
	Runtime error in tests/test.ink line 6: ran out of content. Do you need a '-> DONE' or '-> END'?

We can resolve this with a 'fallback choice'. Fallback choices are never displayed to the player, but are 'chosen' by the game if no other options exist. 

A fallback choice is simply a "choice without choice text":

<Example id="fallback-choice" />

And, in a slight abuse of syntax, we can make a default choice with content in it, using an "choice then arrow":

<Example id="default-choice-with-content" />

### Sticky choices

The 'once-only' behaviour is not always what we want, of course, so we have a second kind of choice: the "sticky" choice. A sticky choice is simply one that doesn't get used up, and is marked by a `+` bullet.

<Example id="sticky-choices" />
	
Default choices can be sticky too.

### Conditional Choices

You can also turn choices on and off by hand. **ink** has quite a lot of logic available, but the simplest tests is "has the player seen a particular piece of content".

Every knot/stitch in the game has a unique address (so it can be diverted to), and we use the same address to test if that piece of content has been seen. 

<Example id="conditionals-and-unique-addresses" />

Note that the test `knot_name` is true if *any* stitch inside that knot has been seen.

Note also that conditionals don't override the once-only behaviour of options, so you'll still need sticky options for repeatable choices.

#### Advanced: multiple conditions

You can use several logical tests on an option; if you do, *all* the tests must all be passed for the option to appear.

<Example id="multiple-conditions" />

#### Advanced: knot/stitch labels are actually read counts

The test: 

	*	{seen_clue} [Accuse Mr Jefferson]

is actually testing an *integer* and not a true/false flag. A knot or stitch used this way is actually an integer variable containing the number of times the content at the address has been seen by the player. 

If it's non-zero, it'll return true in a test like the one above, but you can also be more specific as well:

	* {seen_clue > 3} [Flat-out arrest Mr Jefferson]

#### Advanced: more logic

**ink** supports a lot more logic and conditionality than covered here - see the section on [variables and logic](../chapter-06).
