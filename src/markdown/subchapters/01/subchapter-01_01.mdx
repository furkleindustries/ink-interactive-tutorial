## 1) Content

### The simplest ink script

The most basic ink script is just text in a .ink file.

<Example id="hello-world" />

Text on separate lines produces new paragraphs:

<Example id="hello-world-multiline" />

### Comments 

By default, all text in your file will appear in the output content, unless specially marked up. 

The simplest mark-up is a comment. **ink** supports two kinds of comment. There's the kind used for someone reading the code, which the compiler ignores:

<Example id="comments" />

and there's the kind used for reminding the author what they need to do, that the compiler prints out during compilation:

<Example id="compiler-comments" />

### Tags 

Text content from the game will appear 'as is' when the engine runs. However, it can sometimes be useful to mark up a line of content with extra information to tell the game what to do with that content. 

**ink** provides a simple system for tagging lines of content, with hashtags. 

	=== content 
		A line of normal game-text. # colour it blue

These don't show up in the main text flow, but can be read off by the game and used as you see fit. See [RunningYourInk](https://github.com/inkle/ink/blob/master/Documentation/RunningYourInk.md#marking-up-your-ink-content-with-tags) for more information.
