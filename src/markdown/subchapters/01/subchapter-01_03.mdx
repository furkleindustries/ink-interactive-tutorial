## 3) Knots

### Pieces of content are called knots 

To allow the game to branch we need to mark up sections of content with names (as an old-fashioned gamebook does with its 'Paragraph 18', and the like.) 

These sections are called "knots" and they're the fundamental structural unit of ink content.

### Writing a knot

The start of a knot is indicated by two or more equals signs, as follows.

	=== top_knot ===
	
(The equals signs on the end are optional; and the name needs to be a single word with no spaces.)

The start of a knot is a header; the content that follows will be inside that knot.

	=== back_in_london ===
	
	We arrived into London at 9.45pm exactly.

#### Advanced: a knottier "hello world"

When you start an ink file, content outside of knots will be run automatically. But knots won't. So if you start using knots to hold your content, you'll need to tell the game where to go. We do this with a divert arrow `->`, which is covered properly in the next section.
	
The simplest knotty script is:

<Example id="knot-hello-world" />

However, **ink** doesn't like loose ends, and produces a warning on compilation and/or run-time when it thinks this has happened. It also produces the following error on runtime:

	Runtime error in tests/test.ink line 3: ran out of content. Do you need a '-> DONE' or '-> END'?
	
The following plays and compiles without error:

<Example id="knot-hello-world-working" />
	
`-> END` is a marker for both the writer and the compiler; it means "the story flow should now stop".
